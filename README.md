# Line_Following_Robot
Source code for line follower. Line follower robot senses black line by using sensor and then sends the signal to arduino. Then arduino drives the motor according to sensors' output. Here in this project we are using two IR sensor modules namely left sensor and right sensor. When both left and right sensor senses black then robot move forward
